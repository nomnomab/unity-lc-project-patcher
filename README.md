<!-- About the Project -->
## About the Project
This tool is a game wrapper on top of the [Unity Project Patcher](https://github.com/nomnomab/unity-project-patcher).

This takes a build of Lethal Company, extracts its assets/scripts/etc, and then generates a project for usage in the Unity editor.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This tool does not distribute game files. It simply works off of your copy of the game!
>
> Also, this tool is for **personal** use only. Do not re-distrubute game files to others.
